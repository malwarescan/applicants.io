## ðŸ”§ ONLY 2 CHANGES NEEDED:

### 1. Add MX Record (For Email)

```

**How to add:**
1. Go to cPanel â†’ DNS Zone Editor
2. Click "Add Record"
3. Type: Select "MX"
4. Name: `applicants.io`
5. Priority: `10` (optional)
6. Value: `mx1-hosting.jellyfish.systems`
7. TTL: `14400`
8. Click "Add Record"

### 2. Delete 3 cPanel Autodiscover Records (Cleanup)
**Problem**: Unnecessary records causing conflicts  
**Action**: Delete these records

**Records to DELETE:**
- `autoconfig.applicants.io` (A record pointing to 66.29.146.93)
- `autodiscover.applicants.io` (A record pointing to 66.29.146.93)
- `_autodiscover._tcp.applicants.io` (SRV record)

## âœ… KEEP EVERYTHING ELSE AS-IS

Your current DNS records are perfect! Don't touch:
- âœ… `applicants.io` A â†’ `66.29.146.93`
- âœ… `www.applicants.io` CNAME â†’ `g141wd87.up.railway.app` (Railway)
- âœ… `mail.applicants.io` A â†’ `66.29.146.93`
- âœ… `default._domainkey.applicants.io` TXT (DKIM)
- âœ… `_dmarc.applicants.io` TXT
- âœ… `re4jo2o2oxcr.applicants.io` CNAME (Google verification)
- âœ… `gv-gcrmsmv7mkszro.dv.googlehosted.com.applicants.io` CNAME

## ðŸŽ¯ WHY THIS WILL FIX YOUR 73 "NOT FOUND" ERRORS

The issue is likely that:
1. Missing MX record creates DNS validation issues
2. Autodiscover records conflict with other services
3. Once these are cleaned up, DNS resolution will be stable

The website is already working - these changes ensure everything else works too!

## ðŸ“Š AFTER CHANGES

Wait 15-30 minutes, then test:

```bash
# Test MX record was added
dig applicants.io MX +short
# Should return: mx1-hosting.jellyfish.systems

# Test root domain still works
dig applicants.io +short
# Should return: 66.29.146.93

# Test website still loads
curl -I https://www.applicants.io
# Should return: HTTP/2 200
```

## ðŸš€ SUMMARY

**2 things to do:**
1. Add MX record for email routing
2. Delete 3 autodiscover records for cleanup

**Everything else stays exactly as it is!** âœ…

Your Railway deployment is perfect - no changes needed there!
