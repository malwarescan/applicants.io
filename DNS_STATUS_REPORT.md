## ðŸ“ˆ NEXT STEPS

### For the 73 "Not Found" Errors

These Google Search Console errors are likely due to:
1. **Old URLs** from the previous React app that no longer exist
2. **Time needed** for Google to re-crawl after DNS changes
3. **URL structure changes** between old and new site

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Submit updated sitemap** to Google Search Console
2. **Wait 7-14 days** for Google to re-crawl
3. **Request removal** of old URLs in GSC
4. **Monitor coverage report** in GSC weekly

### Optional: Configure HTTP Redirect

If you want HTTP requests to redirect to HTTPS www:
- **Current**: HTTP â†’ HTTPS (same domain)
- **Optional**: HTTP â†’ HTTPS www

This is cosmetic - your site is working correctly either way.
